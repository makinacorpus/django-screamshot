*django-screamshot* is a **very naive** implementation of Web pages capture
with `CasperJS <http://casperjs.org>`_ (*aaAAaah!*, `phantomjs <http://phantomjs.org>`_:))

(*See the issues pages for more details about what remains to be done.*)

Checkout `screamshotter <https://github.com/makinacorpus/django-screamshot/tree/screamshotter>`_,
the simplest Django project powered by *django-screamshot*.


=======
INSTALL
=======

First make sure you have either the ``casperjs`` or ``phantomjs`` command in your ``PATH``, using
related installation instructions:
 * `CasperJS <http://casperjs.org>`_.
 * `PhantomJS <http://phantomjs.org>`_.

Then install the egg :

::

    pip install django-screamshot


=====
USAGE
=====

* Add ``screamshot`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``


As a screenshot Web API
-----------------------

Add it to your project URLs :

::

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ...
        url(r'^capture/$',  include('screamshot.urls', namespace='screamshot', app_name='screamshot')),
    )

You can then obtain a screenshot using the following GET parameters :

url
  The website URL to capture. This can be a fully qualified URL, or the
  name of a URL to be reversed in your Django project. Note: do not forget to
  encode the url.

selector
  CSS3 selector. It will restrict the screenshot to the selected element.

method
  HTTP method to be used (*default:* ``GET``)

width
  Viewport width (*default:* ``1400``)

height
  Viewport height (*default:* ``900``)

data
  HTTP data to be posted (*default:* ``{}``)

waitfor
  CSS3 selector. The screenshot will be performed only once this selector is
  satisfied. Typical usage: if your page contains a heavy javascript processing,
  you can add a CSS class on an element when the processing is finished to make
  sure the screenshot will get the page properly rendered.

render
  If render=html, it will return an HTML page containing the image and where the
  print diaplo box will be automatically opened.

size
  Resize image (width x height, e.g: ``500x500``), need install ``PIL`` or ``Pillow``.

crop
  If ``true``, then resulting image is cropped to match specified size.

For example : http://server/capture/?url=http://django-fr.org&selector=body&width=1024&height=768&size=500x500



As a template tag
-----------------

You can include screenshots in your pages using a template tag. It will
perform the capture and return the base64 version of the resulting image.

This is very useful if you don't want to expose the capture API publicly.

::

    {% base64capture URL SELECTOR %}


For example, in a SVG template :

::

    {% load screamshot %}
    ...
    
    <image
       y="200"
       x="300"
       id="imagemap"
       xlink:href="data:{% base64capture "company:map" "#map" %}"
       width="640" />


If you run the capture server on a different instance, you can specify the 
root url for reversing (*default is local*) :

::

    SCREAMSHOT_CONFIG = {
        'CAPTURE_ROOT_URL': 'http://127.0.0.1:8001',
    }


As a library - render local Django template
-------------------------------------------
Sometimes, you don't have access to the request object. A typical example would be creating a PDF receipt for a customer and emailing it. Both of these tasks can take a while, so it is natural to push them into some queue (like RabbitMQ). But if your pdf-rendering task get's executed, you don't have access to the request object. Don't worry - you can still use screamshot as a library. Here's how.

::

    from screamshot.utils import render_template

    # you can either render the template to a TemporaryFile:

    with render_template('my-template.html', {'context': 'variables'}) as output:
        # do anything you want with the output
        # like attach it to email message, etc.
        print(output.name)

    # or you can specify a path instead:
    render_template('my-template.html',
        {'context': 'variables'},
        output='/home/you/rendering.png',
        format='png')


Please note, that in order to load your static files, screamshot will try to replace all STATIC_URL occurence with a local path to your static files (only if they are not hosted via https of course)

Customizing the page rendering
------------------------------

The CasperJS script appends the `screamshot` CSS class on the `body` element.
You can easily customize the rendering for printing using this CSS marker in
your CSS stylesheet:

::

  .screamshot #navigation {
    display: none;
  }
  .screamshot #main {
    margin: 2em;
  }

Capture views with authentication
---------------------------------

You can use Basic HTTP authentication in your Django project, create a dedicated
user for screenshots and capture the full URL with credentials (``http://user:password@host/page/``).

Alternatively, you can use a specific view decorator.

Define the authorized IP to capture your pages in your settings :

::

    SCREAMSHOT_CONFIG = {
        'CAPTURE_ALLOWED_IPS': ('127.0.0.1',),
    }

And use the provided decorator : 

::

    from screamshot.decorators import login_required_capturable


    @login_required_capturable
    def your_view(request):
        ...


Renderer command and CLI arguments
----------------------------------
You can specify which renderer you would like to use, by setting the 
``CAPTURE_METHOD`` setting. The default value is 'casperjs'. Possible values
are 'casperjs' and 'phantomjs'.

::

    SCREAMSHOT_CONFIG = {
        'CAPTURE_METHOD': 'phantomjs',
    }


By default, we look for thr CasperJS/PhantomJS binary in the ``PATH``
environment variable (like ``which``), but you can bypass this:

::

    SCREAMSHOT_CONFIG = {
        'CASPERJS_CMD': '/home/you/Downloads/apps/casperjs',
        'PHANTOMJS_CMD': '/home/you/Downloads/apps/phantomjs'
    }


Please note, that the ``CAPTURE_METHOD`` setting specifies which location would
be evaluated, i.e. if you set ``CAPTURE_METHOD`` to 'phantomjs', ``PHANTOMJS_CMD``
would be evaluated.

You can also specify PhantomJS/CasperJS extra-args, such as
 ``--disk-cache=true`` with the ``CLI_ARGS`` setting :

::

    SCREAMSHOT_CONFIG = {
        'CLI_ARGS': ['--disk-cache=true', '--max-disk-cache-size=30000']
    }

See related documentation on PhantomJS and CasperJS homepages.


You can also override the capture script. A default implementation uses capture
script written for CasperJS. A default capture script for PhantomJS is also provided.

If you have your own script which you would like to use, specify it in 
``CAPTURE_SCRIPT`` option.

::

    SCREAMSHOT_CONFIG = {
        'CAPTURE_SCRIPT': '/home/you/scripts/capture.js',
    }

You can add timeout corresponding to maximum time to wait for CSS3 selector (see waitfor option)

::

    SCREAMSHOT_CONFIG = {
        'TIMEOUT': 7000 #ms 5000 by default,
    }

Notes about runserver
---------------------

If you want to test it using ``manage.py runserver``, you won't be able
to capture pages coming from the same instance.

Run it twice (on two ports) and configure ``CAPTURE_ROOT_URL``.
